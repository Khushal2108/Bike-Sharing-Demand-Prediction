# Bike-Sharing-Demand-Prediction

Bike-sharing Service
The bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short-term basis for a price or free. Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a computer-controlled dock, where a user can enter the payment information for the system to unlock it. The user can further return the bike to any other computer-controlled dock belonging to the same system.

Case of BoomBikes
BoomBikes is a US-based bike-sharing provider. It has recently suffered considerable dips in its revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic and is finding it very difficult to sustain itself in the current market scenario. They have decided to align their future business with a Machine Learning based model to recover from the current business scenario once lockdown ends. They aspire to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after the quarantine situation ends. They have planned this to prepare themselves to cater to the people's needs once the situation gets better all around and stand out from other service providers and make huge profits.

Project Goal
With this project, we will try:

To understand the factors on which the demand for these shared bikes depends.
To identify the variables that are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
To understand how well a variable describes the bike demands if a Variable is significant.
Business Goal:
With this Machine Learning project, we will try to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables.

This model can be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market.
